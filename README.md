# Home Monitoring Program (Winner of REWIRED HACK DAYS LONDON 2019) #

This project is to help reduce mortality in babies with severe congenital heart conditions (e.g. HLHS).
This web application is designed for the parent to use to capture baby's condition such as Weight and Feed, etc. This information is updated real-time with the hospital patient record and a dashboard highlights babies with 'red flags' (or exceeding recommended parameters). Further action as deemed necessary by the clinician / nursing staff may be taken based on this.

## Note ##

This web application was built in the REWIRED HACK DAYS LONDON 2019 in two days. To be able to get this ready for the demo, the code quality is not great and is not ready for production use.
